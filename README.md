## Overview

This devops playground is about building infrastructure for cluster nodes and training devops techniques and technologies like ansible, kubernetes, github actions for ci/cd pipelines and so on and more ...

---

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure is built with existing VPS resources, if they will not be sufficient during testing, an scale up is possible.  
SRV2 will serve as a bridge to the world and a controller for nodes on a private network.
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is used on all VPS.

**Allocable resources:**  
CPU cores: 16 shared  
RAM: 8GB  
Disk space: 240GB

**Allocated resources:**  
SRV2 and each node has been allocated the same resources so far ...  
CPU cores: 2  
RAM: 1GB  
Disk space: 30GB  

### SRV2, controller & gateway

SRV2 is configured and administered locally/manually for now. The nodes are administered from here using ansible.  
[SRV2 configuration procedure](/docs/srv2_config.md)  
This configuration is sufficient from the security point of view for now, if necessary further configuration will be made on the basis of the results and recommendations of the lynis audit system.

### Nodes

Nodes were created manually with basic configuration, then they are managed using ansible from SRV2.
